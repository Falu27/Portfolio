I am a proactive person and passionate about technology, always looking to keep up to date with the latest trends and tools in the field of programming. So with time and effort, I positioned myself as a Front-End Developer at CoderHouse and Academia-X. Some time later I finished my BackEnd stack MERN studies. In addition to my computer science studies, I am a student at the language faculty, to improve my level of English. I would like to apply my knowledge and skills, add value to a team of programmers. I am willing to learn and develop professionally, and I am confident that I can contribute to success."
